# My Whitefox Keyboard Configuration for macOS

This is my layout for [Matt3o's Whitefox keyboard](https://input.club/whitefox). Since I use macOS primarily, the modifier keys are setup to match Apple's default configuration: ctrl, alt, cmd.

## Key Features

* Modifier keys are setup according to Apple's standard: ctrl, alt, cmd.
* Includes function keys for: volume, media, eject (useful for putting your Mac to sleep) and LED brightness.
* Home and End for when you find yourself using Windows.

## Installation

1. [Download a copy of the configuration](https://github.com/boyvanamstel/Whitefox-keyboard-macOS-configuration/archive/master.zip).
2. [Follow Input Club's guide to install the customized firmware](https://input.club/configurator-setup).

_Note_: The little hole in the bottom of the Whitefox keyboard activates firmware-flashing-mode. No need to take it apart.
